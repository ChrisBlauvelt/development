	\begin{itemize}
		\item Currently I am using NixOS as my "daily-driver" operating system, as it allows me the ability to create declarative shell environments to quickly test packages.
		\item Using LaTeX as well as an IDE allowed me the granularity that I was seeking when creating a personalized resume, and the journey of implementing it has been a fun challenge!
		\item Building my personal website using a static site generated with next.js and deployed using Github has been an amazing opportunity to compile all of my systems-administration skills to be able to host the site completely for free, aside from the domain name. This project strengthened my systems-administration acumen, and helped to increase my CI/CD comprehension with a NO2-like boost, not to mention re-igniting my love for back-end web development
