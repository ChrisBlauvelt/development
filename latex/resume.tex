\section{Education}
\cventry{2012--2016}{Bachelor of Arts}{Appalachian State University}{Boone}{}{Major: Philosophy}

\section{Experience}
\cventry{2021--2024}{I.T. Project + Deployment Engineer}{360 Smart Networks}{Roswell}{}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed and maintained processes and best practice documentation for software integrations, UNIX commandline best practices for appliance-based distributions, as well as Microsoft Entra I.D. and Azure
\item Collaborated with cross-functional teams to meet expected deadlines and targets, while maintaining the highest degree of security and reproducibility for an MSP that was undergoing an enormous growth period
\end{itemize}
}


\section{Current Projects/Specializations}
\cventry{IaC}{LaTeX and Infrastructure As Code}{}{}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Currently I am using NixOS as my "daily-driver" operating system, as it allows me the ability to create declarative shell environments to quickly test packages.
		\item Using LaTeX as well as an IDE allowed me the granularity that I was seeking when creating a personalized resume, and the journey of implementing it has been a fun challenge!
		\item Building my personal website using a static site generated with next.js and deployed using Github has been an amazing opportunity to compile all of my systems-administration skills to be able to host the site completely for free, aside from the domain name. This project strengthened my systems-administration acumen, and helped to increase my CI/CD comprehension with a NO2-like boost, not to mention re-igniting my love for back-end web development
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{virt}{Virtualization/Containerization + Hypervisor Administration}{Proxmox, KVM/QEMU, LXC, nix, vmWare, Hyper-V}{}{}{ 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Containerization of applications is the technological concept that fascinated me upon first learning of Docker in the late 2010's, and from that point, my infatuation with declarative environments, resource-clustering, and management of container-host networking have continued to fuel my passion to continue learning and exploring cutting-edge technologies in my spare time.
	\end{itemize}
}

\section{Supplementary Experience | Certifications}
\cvdoubleitem[8pt]{Project Management}{Starting my working life in the restaurant industry during High School allowed me to learn a plethora of problem-solving techniques, paired with my degree in Philosophy, I believe that my diverse work background--including positions as a Brand Ambassador for a local Boar's Head Distributor as well as one of the lead trainers at The El Felix Restaurant in the Avalon will continue to afford me extra insights into problem solving methodologies and overcome technical hurdles with ease}{Customer Relationship Management}{Playing off of these same strengths, I hope to be able to leverage my interpersonal skills to help bridge the gap between complicated technical systems, and the human capital that powers our economy.}
